= Intro

- Implicitly returns 0
- Return types are written in front of the function name or as trailing
  return-types in declarations (because who needs consistency, amirite)

- Header files can be either `*.hpp` or `*.h`
- Regarding include order: It is good practice to include own-headers (`""`)
  before system-headers (`<>`). The first is usually used for the header files
  belonging to the project itself, while the latter is used for includes of the
  standard library and external libraries. However, _this difference is only
  conventional, as any toolchain could just specify their own lookup rules for
  the two distinct kinds of includes_.

== Compilation

3 Phases of compilation:

/ Preprocessor: Textual replacement of preprocessor directives (`#include`)
/ Compiler: Translation of C++ code into machine code (source file to object file)
/ Linker: Combination of object files and libraries into libraries and executables

== Declarations and definitions

All things with a name that you use in a C++ program must be declared before you can do so
- E.g. a function that you call (major difference from C)
- A type that you use for a variable (except some built-ins)
- A variable that you use

There can only be one definition of the same function (_One Definition Rule_/ODR), in
contrast to declaration, which can be done several times.

=== `#include` guards

```cpp #include``` guards ensure that a header file is only included once.
Necessary for functions and class type definitions, good practice either way.

```cpp
#ifndef GUARD_HPP_
#define GUARD_HPP_
// ...
#endif /* GUARD_HPP_ */
```

=== Functions

Declarations
```
auto          <function-name>(<parameters>) -> <return-type>;
<return-type> <function-name>(<parameters>);
```

Definitions
```
auto          <function-name>(<parameters>) -> <return-type> { /*body*/}
<return-type> <function-name>(<parameters>)                  { /*body*/}
```

If a function has a non-void return type it must return a value on every path
(or throw an exception).

=== Values and references

```cpp
struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};
```

Copying vs. Sharing:

```cpp
Point point{1, 20};

Point copiedPoint{point};
Point & sharedPoint{point};

auto copydPointParam(Point point) -> Point { }
auto referencePointParam(Point & point) -> Point { }
```

== Libraries

- #link("https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2", "catch2")
- #link("http://www.boost.org/", "boost")

= Values and Streams

== Variables

```
<type> <variable-name>{<initial-value>};
```

Using `=` or `{}` for initialization with a value supplied we can have the
compiler determine its type.

```cpp
auto const i = 5;
```

Initialization might be omitted but that is bad practice and potentially
dangerous.

```cpp
double x;
```

Adding the const keyword in front of the name makes the variable a single-assignment variable,
aka a constant which is immutable and must be initialized. Some constants are
required to be fixed at compile time (```cpp constexpr```). The keyword ```cpp const``` also appears in other contexts.

```cpp
int const theAnswer{42};
double constexpr pi{3.14};
```

You should use ```cpp const``` whenever possible for non-member variables.
